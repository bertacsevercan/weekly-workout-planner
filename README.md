# Weekly Workout Planner

The purpose of this project was to create a board app which is similar to a to-do app. My partner and I decided to do a weekly-workout-planning app. In this project, I've used ReactJS for the first time and it was such a good practice for me to understand React. I've also used Ant Design to style the application and used Google's Firebase to store user data.

- Topics practised: Pair-programming, React, Firebase, Ant Design

- Technologies used: React, Firebase; Cloud Firestore, JavaScript, Netlify, Ant Design
